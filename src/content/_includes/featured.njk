      <p>
        After signing the Enterprise agreement with Microsoft, its time to start onboarding your first team to your Azure environment. How do you setup networking? How do you manage access controls? Where are the access logs? How do we prevent cyber attacks? What do we do with the existing applications in our data centers?
        In this session, we will cover the steps in creating an Azure environment for the enterprise by exploring different options available to satisfy enterprise requirements. These include: Policies, Role Based Access Controls, Disaster Recovery, and more.
